## In this exercise, you'll need to get the country names and other 2015 data in the economies table and the countries table 
## for Central American countries with an official language.
-- Select fields
SELECT DISTINCT name, total_investment, imports
  -- From table (with alias)
  FROM economies AS e
    -- Join with table (with alias)
    LEFT JOIN countries AS c
      -- Match on code

      -- and code in Subquery
        AND e.code IN (
          SELECT l.code
          FROM languages AS l
          WHERE official = 'true'
        ) )
  -- Where region and year are correct
  WHERE year = 2015 AND region = 'Central America'
-- Order by field
ORDER BY name;


##calculate the average fertility rate for each region in 2015.
-- Select fields
SELECT region, continent, avg(fertility_rate) AS avg_fert_rate
  -- From left table

  WHERE year = 2015
-- Group appropriately
GROUP BY region,continent
-- Order appropriately
