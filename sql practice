          WHERE official = 'true'
        ) )
  -- Where region and year are correct
  WHERE year = 2015 AND region = 'Central America'
-- Order by field
ORDER BY name;


##calculate the average fertility rate for each region in 2015.
-- Select fields
SELECT region, continent, avg(fertility_rate) AS avg_fert_rate

-UPDATE student SET GPA=3.5;
-SELECT FirstName AS "First Name";
-SELECT * FROM Fruits WHERE Name = 'Apple';
-Create Table :
CREATE TABLE right (a INTEGER, b TEXT, c TEXT);
INSERT INTO right VALUES ( 1, 'This', 'Right here!' );
INSERT INTO right (b,c) VALUES ('That', 'Over there!' );
INSERT INTO right DEFAULT VALUES;

-The DROP TABLE statement enables you to delete a table from a database and if the table did not exist then attempting to DROP it would cause an error to occur.

`Constraint: 
CREATE TABLE People (FirstName TEXT DEFAULT 'Mickey', address TEXT, city TEXT);

-The SELECT DISTINCT statement removes duplicates from a result set.
